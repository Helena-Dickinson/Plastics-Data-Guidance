## Executive Summary

## Section 1 – Introduction

The global challenge of plastic pollution demands evidence-based policy responses underpinned by robust data and monitoring systems. Countries worldwide recognise the urgent need to track and measure plastic flows through their economies and environments. However, developing comprehensive data across the full lifecycle of plastic products - from production through consumption to waste management and environmental release - presents significant technical and institutional challenges. To address this critical gap, this guide provides government officials and practitioners with a structured approach to developing and implementing national plastics data management systems, offering practical solutions adaptable to diverse country contexts.

Building on established international frameworks, this guide supports countries in developing national plastics inventories and accounts while strengthening institutional capacity for ongoing data management. It provides step-by-step guidance for systematic evaluation of plastics data, while facilitating coordination among key stakeholders - from data generators and users to policymakers. This coordinated approach enables countries to effectively track progress on both national and international commitments related to plastics management and reduction.

The guidance covers the entire plastics data lifecycle, encompassing production data for both primary plastics and plastic products, consumption patterns and trends, trade flows including imports and exports, comprehensive waste management from collection through recycling and disposal, and environmental releases and impacts. Throughout each stage, the guide provides practical tools and approaches that can be adapted to different national contexts and capacities. Recognizing that countries have varying starting points in their plastics data journey, this guide is designed to be adaptable to different national contexts and capacities.

### Moving Forward

The development of comprehensive plastics data management systems begins with a thorough assessment of existing data availability through the Plastics Data Checklist. This is combined with an evaluation of institutional capacity and mapping of key stakeholders and their roles. This foundational analysis enables systematic data collection and verification, using both established national and international sources while implementing new data collection mechanisms where needed.

Following this assessment, countries perform a detailed gap analysis to identify critical missing data points and prioritize areas for improvement. This analysis shapes the development of targeted action plans for enhanced data collection. The system development phase then focuses on establishing robust institutional frameworks, building technical capacity, and implementing effective data management systems.

The final focus is on long-term sustainability, ensuring these systems continue to function through ongoing stakeholder engagement, regular data updates, and continuous monitoring of progress. This enables adaptation as needs evolve and capabilities grow.

The subsequent chapters provide detailed guidance on each of these steps, along with practical tools, templates, and case studies to support implementation.

## Section 2 – Tools and Resources

### 2.1 Plastics Data Checklist

#### Overview

The Plastics Data Checklist is a comprehensive tool developed by the UNSW Centre for Sustainable Development Reform to assist governments, policymakers, and practitioners evaluate their national plastics data. This systematic assessment tool supports countries in delivering on commitments from UNEA Resolution UNEA-5.2/Res 14 and preparing for the implementation of the Global Plastics Treaty. The Plastics Data Checklist compiles a comprehensive list of plastic data categories and serves as a foundational step in developing robust national plastics inventories. Through using the tool, countries can facilitate systematic evaluation of plastics data to identify data availability and reliability. The tool supports informed policy decisions and resource allocation while promoting cross-sector coordination among national data holders.

#### Objectives

The Plastics Data Checklist was developed to achieve the following objectives:

* Facilitate a systematic evaluation of national plastics data across the plastics lifecycle and into the environment
* Identify which data points are available and their reliability
* Identify areas for improvement in data collection and management
* Inform policy decisions and resource allocation for enhanced plastics management
* Promote coordination across sectors and national data holders
* Contribute to the development of a comprehensive national plastics inventory

#### Using the Plastics Data Checklist

To use the Plastics Data Checklist, it is recommended to first familiarise oneself with the plastics data categories and their interconnectivities (Please see Figure X for a visual representation). The data assessment process is set out below:

1. Identify relevant National Institutions (such as the national statistics office, environmental departments, customs office, and industry stakeholders)
2. Consult with national institutions to identify existing data sources
3. Gather information on data collection methods, spatial resolution, frequency of data updates, and known limitations for each dataset
4. Evaluate data availability using a 'traffic light' system:

   * Green for compressive, fit-for-purpose and nationally available data
   * Amber for partially available and fit-for-purpose data
   * Red for unavailable or inadequate data

   Simultaneously, practitioners assess data reliability on a three-tier system:
   * High - data that is representative and scientifically sound
   * Moderate - data that is partially representative or uses less preferred methodologies
   * Low - data with limited representativeness or methodological rigor

5. Assess data gaps in plastics data availability
6. Prioritise areas for actionable improvements

Using the detailed information and structured approach in this guide, potential gaps can be filled, and a comprehensive plastics data management system can be developed.

Throughout this process, practitioners should maintain detailed documentation of findings, barriers, and improvement opportunities, all while considering the data's fitness for national reporting and monitoring purposes.

### 2.2 Global Plastics Data Tracker

#### Overview

The Global Plastics Data Tracker is a data platform developed by the Global Ocean Accounts Partnership and the UNSW Centre for Sustainable Development Reform to address the critical need for accessible national-level plastics data. The platform serves as a centralised repository for tracking plastics-related official data across the entire supply chain, providing access to country-specific information. The tracker specifically focuses on government-published data and statistics, offering a comprehensive view of how plastic moves through global economies and environments. The tracker was developed to address the lack of consolidated plastics data that has hindered effective global and national decision-making in addressing plastics pollution.

#### Objectives

The Global Plastics Data Tracker was developed to achieve the following objectives:

* Identify and raise awareness of the gaps in global plastics data reporting and highlight areas where countries need improved data collection and reporting mechanisms
* Enable tracking of the full plastics lifecycle, including production, consumption, trade and waste management
* Facilitate international learning by enabling countries to access, observe and learn from other nations' data collection and presentation methods
* Support various stakeholders in monitoring progress and targeting support in plastics management more effectively

#### Using the Global Plastics Data Tracker

The Global Plastics Data Tracker presents plastics data for all UN Member States across the key stages of the plastics lifecycle in line with the Plastics Data Checklist (Section 2.1) including production, consumption, trade, and waste data. The tracker employs a systematic scoring system to evaluate data quality and accessibility. Each data point receives a 'data score' ranging from one to five, indicating its suitability for informing annual plastic flows within a country. The higher scores are awarded to data that is published annually with plastic-specific breakdowns. The lower scores are given to one-off data points with no plastic-specific breakdowns.

## Section 5

### 5.1 Extraction of existing data

In the first instance, a country should extract as much data as possible from current sources of published and unpublished data.

The focus should be on extracting data for tonnages of "plastics and products containing plastics". If possible, data points could be enhanced by splitting data into:
* Plastic types (e.g., by resin (PET, HDPE etc))
* Plastic form (e.g., rigid, flexible etc)
* Plastic applications (packaging, construction etc)
* Amount of plastics contained in "products containing plastics"

#### Review the Data Tracker Platform

The CSDR has developed a platform that collates plastics data sources for all countries. The data for each country is split into production, consumption, trade and waste categories.

Users should use the data sources in this tracker to extract plastics data – there is an option to download this data in a "checklist" form for the country – this format shows what data is available and where there are gaps.

1. Access the CSDR platform "Global Plastics Data Tracker"
2. Download country-specific checklist with data sources

#### Extraction of National Data

Beyond the data sources listed in the Tracker, the user should take stock of any other data that the government and businesses in the country currently collect (even if not published). The user should use the pre-filled in data checklist to support this action.

3. Survey existing government databases and reporting systems
4. Review business reporting requirements and compliance data

The below datasets can be reviewed to extract further plastics data. Further detail on the reporting process, data and geographic coverage of each of the datasets listed is set out in Annex xx.

#### Extraction of Production Data

5. To gather production data, users should check if the country currently reports into one of the below databases.

* Industrial Commodity Statistics Database (UNSD)
* Prodcom database (Eurostat)

#### Extraction of Consumption Data

6. To gather consumption data, users should check if their country currently report into one of the below databases and/or consider utilising the "Apparent Consumption" method.

* Extended producer responsibility scheme reports
* Industry reports and datasets
* When exact data isn't available, you can use the "apparent consumption" methodology:
  * Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports – Exports

#### Extraction of Trade Data

7. To gather trade data, users should check if their country currently report into one of the below databases.

Trade data is usually categorised through either Harmonised System (HS) codes or Standardised Industrial Trade Code (SITC). The specific plastics codes to search for are summarized in the following tables:

##### Harmonised System (HS) Codes
| Category | Codes |
|----------|--------|
| Primary Plastics | 3901-3909 |
| Plastic Products | 3916-3926 |
| Plastic Waste | 3915 |

##### Standard International Trade Classification
| Category | Codes |
|----------|--------|
| Primary Plastics | 571-575 |
| Plastic Products | 893 |
| Plastic Waste | 579 |

Available databases include:
* UN Comtrade database
* UNCTADstat Data Centre
* Comext database from Eurostat
* UNEP Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML) Digital Platform
* National customs data

#### Extraction of Waste Data

Waste data is usually categorised through either European Waste Codes or Basel Convention codes. Specific plastics codes to search for are summarized below:

##### European Waste Classification (EWC)
| Category | Codes |
|----------|--------|
| Clean Plastics | 02 01 04, 07 02 13, 12 01 05 |
| Plastic Packaging | 15 01 02 |
| Mixed Plastics | 19 12 04, 20 01 39 |

##### Basel Convention
| Category | Codes |
|----------|--------|
| Plastic Waste (Special) | Y48 |
| Hazardous Plastic Waste | A3210 |
| Clean Recyclable Waste | B3011 |

8. To gather waste data, users should check if their country utilise waste composition splits and other waste data in their National Inventory Reporting calculations. Users should also check if their country report into one of the other listed data platforms:

* UNFCCC National Inventory Reporting (Net Zero Waste Sector data)
* Eurostat Waste Statistics
* Basel Convention Reporting
* UNEP Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML) Digital Platform

#### Extraction of Data for plastics in the environment

### 5.2 Data Validation

To verify data values and sources, it is advisable to:
a) Cross-validate between different data sources.
b) Account for double-counting risks if summing data from multiple sources.
c) Check that assumptions and conversion factors are listed and evidence-based.

For each data point category in the checklist, it is useful to assign RAG-rating to keep track of which sources of data are more/less robust. Data sources with Red or Amber-Red RAG-rating should be considered for prioritised improvement.

| Data availability | Data collection/generation | Degree of uncertainty | RAG-rating |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Direct availability | Data collected directly from official statistics or statistics with a verified methodology | Small | Green |
| Indirect availability | Data collected from a proxy statistic such as monetary equivalency | Medium | Amber |
| Estimation | Projection or forecast using verified data | High | Amber-Red |
| Mass balance | Flow computed by balancing corresponding inputs and outputs | Very high | Red |

#### Specific examples of quality assurance approaches

##### Production Data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
* Cross-check between national and international databases
* Compare with industry capacity data
* Validate against trade flows

Key Quality Issues:
* Time lags in reporting
* Potential missing data from small producers

##### Consumption data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
* Cross-validate apparent consumption calculations with market surveys
* Compare with industry reports
* Check consistency with waste generation data

Key Quality Issues:
* Apparent consumption doesn't capture stockpiling
* Informal market activities won't be captured

##### Trade data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
* Compare mirror statistics between trading partners
* Cross-validate between national and international databases
* Check for reporting thresholds and exemptions

Key Quality Issues:
* Small shipments may be excluded due to reporting thresholds
* Plastic waste trades often poorly recorded
* Differences in partner country reporting

##### Waste data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
* Compare with consumption data
* Cross-check between different stages of waste management
* Validate against EPR collection data (if available)

Key Quality Issues:
* Informal sector activities not captured
* Mixed waste streams difficult to characterise
* Inconsistent measurement approaches between jurisdictions

### 5.3 Gap Analysis

Upon concluding the assessment of current data (extracting the data and verifying its accuracy), the gaps in the data checklist should be identified.

The next step is choosing which data categories should be prioritised for development.

#### Prioritisation of data

Prioritisation depends on an individual countries preferences. When a country considers which data to improve first, it should take account of:
* The ease to fill data gaps
* The countries need for different types of data

UNEP(xx) guidance (unpublished) advises that prioritisation of data should follow the below steps:

1. Development of datasets on plastic production and consumption
   * Collecting statistics on production of plastic
   * Collecting statistics on trade of plastic
   * Estimating consumption based on the 'apparent consumption' methodology

2. Development of plastic waste datasets
   * Estimating plastic waste generated based on 'consumption lifespan' methodology
   * Collecting statistics on plastic waste collection
   * Collecting statistics on trade of plastic waste and trade of plastic embedded in waste

The UNEP guidelines prioritise three main measurement flows:
* Plastic in primary forms
* Semi-finished plastic products
* Plastic in finished products

With finished products, there's a specific emphasis on tracking:
* Pure plastic products (easier to measure, 100% plastic content)
* High-volume categories like packaging
* Products with significant environmental impact

## Section 6 – Tools for plastic data collection

The core principles for data collection are:
* Review multiple data sources where possible to ensure accuracy
* Apply consistent methodologies over time
* Document assumptions and limitations

### Plastic-KEYS

When establishing plastic data collection systems, governments should structure their approach to align with the Plastic-KEYs classification system. This enables better harmonization of data across different reporting frameworks and supports international comparison.

For each category you collect data on, record:
* Primary polymer type(s)
* Application/use category
* Weight or quantity
* Source of material (virgin/recycled)
* Expected lifetime in use
* Conversion factors used

There are Eight Plastic-KEY Groups:
* P1 Packaging
* P2 Transport
* P3 Building and construction
* P4 Electrical and electronic equipment
* P5 Consumer and institutional products
* P6 Industrial machinery
* P7 Textiles
* P8 Other

### 6.1 Surveys

For all data categories, surveys can be used to improve plastics data – the key steps to take when implementing a new survey are listed below:

1. Implement standardised reporting templates
2. Establish clear reporting timeframes
3. Choose your classification system (see Annex xx)
4. Use consistent units and conversion factors
5. Document assumptions and conversion factors

### 6.2 Conversion of monetary values and volumes to tonnages

To reveal plastics tonnage data, it may be possible to use conversion factors. It's important to note that these conversion factors are approximations and can vary based on specific products, brands, manufacturing processes, and market conditions. They are often used for broad estimates and trend analysis rather than precise calculations.

| Sector | Conversion | Metric | Source (year) |
|--------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Packaging sector | $ to tonnes (packaged food) | $1000 spent on packaged food = 20-25kg of plastic packaging | Ellen MacArthur Foundation, New Plastics Economy (2016) |
| Electronics sector | $ to tonnes (electronics industry) | $100 spent on smart phones = 30-40 grams of plastic | The United Nations University |
| Automotive sector | $ to tonnes (automotive industry) | $10,000 spent on cars = 150-200 kg of plastic | Plastics Europe Market Research Group (2022) |
| Consumer goods | $ to tonnes (toy industry) | $100 in plastic toys = 2-2.5kg plastic material | Toy Industries of Europe (2021) |

### 6.3 Developing Production data

#### Role of other countries
Other countries can provide valuable data and insights to help inform a country about its plastic production:
* Import Records/customs data: Detailed records of plastic and plastic product imports into other countries, would reflect a fraction of the production.

#### Role of Businesses
Businesses can provide data through:
* Business reports and/or National production surveys on:
  * The types and quantities of plastics produced
  * Amounts of raw materials used in plastic production
  * Production capacities and actual output from multinational companies operating in multiple countries
  * Raw materials sourced from other countries for plastic production

* EPR data: If a country has an EPR scheme, importers or producers may be obliged to report on the data of products placed on the market. However, important to note that businesses may be incentivised to under report.

#### Role of Technology
* Geographic Information Systems (GIS):
  * Use GIS to create detailed maps of production facilities

* Satellite Imagery and Remote Sensing:
  * Monitor changes in land use related to resource extraction
  * Track the growth or reduction of mining sites over time

* Drone Technology:
  * Survey hard-to-reach areas or large territories to map resource extraction sites

* Sensors and Real-time Tracking:
  * Implement sensors at production facilities to measure output in real-time
  * Use RFID tags or GPS trackers on waste containers to monitor movement and final disposal locations
