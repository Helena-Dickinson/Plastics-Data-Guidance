Executive Summary

 
Section 1 – Introduction
The global challenge of plastic pollution demands evidence-based policy responses underpinned by robust data and monitoring systems. Countries worldwide recognise the urgent need to track and measure plastic flows through their economies and environment. However, developing comprehensive data across the full lifecycle of plastic - from production through consumption to waste management and environmental release - presents significant technical and institutional challenges. To address these challenges, the UNSW Centre for Sustainable Development Reform has prepared this guide to provide government officials and practitioners with a structured approach to developing and implementing national plastics data management systems, offering practical solutions adaptable to diverse country contexts and priorities.
Building on established international frameworks, this guide will support countries to develop national inventories for plastics data and structure data into a framework for plastic accounts while strengthening institutional capacity for ongoing data management. It provides step-by-step guidance for systematic evaluation, collection and management of plastics data, while facilitating coordination among key stakeholders - from data generators and users to policymakers. This coordinated approach enables countries to effectively track progress on both national and international commitments related to plastics management and reduction.
The guidance covers the entire plastics data lifecycle, encompassing production data for both primary plastics and plastic products, consumption patterns and trends, trade flows including imports and exports, comprehensive waste management from collection through recycling and disposal, and environmental releases and impacts. Throughout each stage, the guide provides practical tools and approaches that can be adapted to different national contexts and capacities. Recognising that countries have varying starting points in their plastics data journey, this guide is designed to be adaptable to different national contexts and capacities.
As part of this lifecycle, plastic production primarily relies on raw materials such as crude oil, natural gas, and coal, which undergo key processes like refining, polymerization, polycondensation, and compounding. The materials used in plastic manufacturing vary widely based on polymer types and their intended functions. However, this guideline specifically focuses on the movement of plastic within the economy and its flows into the environment, rather than the raw material inputs. The plastic life cycle, as defined here, begins with plastic in its primary forms.
 
Moving Forward
The development of comprehensive plastics data management systems begins with a thorough assessment of existing data availability through the Plastics Data Checklist. This is combined with an evaluation of institutional capacity and mapping of key stakeholders and their roles. This foundational analysis enables systematic data collection and verification, using both established national and international sources while implementing new data collection mechanisms where needed.
Following this assessment, countries perform a detailed gap analysis to identify critical missing data points and prioritize areas for improvement. This analysis shapes the development of targeted action plans for enhanced data collection. The system development phase then focuses on establishing robust institutional frameworks, building technical capacity, and implementing effective data management systems.
The final focus is on long-term sustainability, ensuring these systems continue to function through ongoing stakeholder engagement, regular data updates, and continuous monitoring of progress. This enables adaptation as needs evolve and capabilities grow.
The subsequent chapters provide detailed guidance on each of these steps, along with practical tools, templates, and case studies to support implementation.

Section 2 – Tools and Resources 
2.1 Plastics Data Checklist
Overview
The Plastics Data Checklist is a comprehensive tool developed by the UNSW Centre for Sustainable Development Reform to assist governments, policymakers, and practitioners evaluate their national plastics data. This systematic assessment tool supports countries in delivering on commitments from UNEA Resolution UNEA-5.2/Res 14 and preparing for the implementation of the Global Plastics Treaty. The Plastics Data Checklist compiles a comprehensive list of plastic data categories and serves as a foundational step in developing robust national plastics inventories. Through using the tool, countries can facilitate systematic evaluation of plastics data to identify data availability and reliability. The tool supports informed policy decisions and resource allocation while promoting cross-sector coordination among national data holders. 
Objectives
The Plastics Data Checklist was developed to achieve the following objectives: 
•	Facilitate a systematic evaluation of national plastics data across the plastics lifecycle and into the environment
•	Identify which data points are available and their reliability
•	Identify areas for improvement in data collection and management
•	Inform policy decisions and resource allocation for enhanced plastics management
•	Promote coordination across sectors and national data holders
•	Contribute to the development of a comprehensive national plastics inventory.

Using the Plastics Data Checklist
To use the Plastics Data Checklist, it is recommended to first familiarise oneself with the plastics data categories and their interconnectivities (Please see Figure X for a visual representation). The data assessment process is set out below.
1.	Identify relevant National Institutions (such as the national statistics office, environmental departments, customs office, and industry stakeholders)
2.	Consult with national institutions to identify existing data sources
3.	Gather information on data collection methods, spatial resolution, frequency of data updates, and known limitations for each dataset
4.	Evaluate data availability using a ‘traffic light’ system: 

	Green for compressive, fit-for-purpose and nationally available data
	Amber for partially available and fit-for-purpose data
	Red for unavailable or inadequate data

Simultaneously, practitioners assess data reliability on a three-tier system: 
	High - data that is representative and scientifically sound
	Moderate - data that is partially representative or uses less preferred methodologies
	Low - data with limited representativeness or methodological rigor

5.	Assess data gaps in plastics data availability
6.	Prioritise areas for actionable improvements
Using the detailed information and structured approach in this guide, potential gaps can be filled, and a comprehensive plastics data management system can be developed. 
Throughout this process, practitioners should maintain detailed documentation of findings, barriers, and improvement opportunities, all while considering the data’s fitness for national reporting and monitoring purposes.

2.2 Global Plastics Data Tracker
Overview 
The Global Plastics Data Tracker is a data platform developed by the Global Ocean Accounts Partnership and the UNSW Centre for Sustainable Development Reform to address the critical need for accessible national-level plastics data. The platform serves as a centralised repository for tracking plastics-related official data across the entire supply chain, providing access to country-specific information. The tracker specifically focuses on government-published data and statistics, offering a comprehensive view of how plastic moves through global economies and environments. The tracker was developed to address the lack of consolidated plastics data that has hindered effective global and national decision-making in addressing plastics pollution. 
Objectives 
The Global Plastics Data Tracker was developed to achieve the following objectives: 
•	Identify and raise awareness of the gaps in global plastics data reporting and highlight areas where countries need improved data collection and reporting mechanisms 
•	Enable tracking of the full plastics lifecycle, including production, consumption, trade and waste management 
•	Facilitate international learning by enabling countries to access, observe and learn from other nations’ data collection and presentation methods  
•	Support various stakeholders in monitoring progress and targeting support in plastics management more effectively

Using the Global Plastics Data Tracker 
The Global Plastics Data Tracker presents plastics data for all UN Member States across the key stages of the plastics lifecycle in line with the Plastics Data Checklist (Section 2.1) including production, consumption, trade, and waste data. The tracker employs a systematic scoring system to evaluate data quality and accessibility. Each data point receives a ‘data score’ ranging from one to five, indicating its suitability for informing annual plastic flows within a country. The higher scores are awarded to data that is published annually with plastic-specific breakdowns. The lower scores are given to one-off data points with no plastic-specific breakdowns. The full breakdown of the data scores can be found in Table X. Users may apply several filters and the search bar to easily access individual data points. Additionally, hyperlinks on each data point take users to the data source of each data point.

5.1 Extraction of existing data
In the first instance, a country should extract as much data as possible from current sources of published and unpublished data.
The focus should be on extracting data for tonnages of “plastics and products containing plastics”. If possible, data points could be enhanced by splitting data into:
	Plastic types (e.g., by resin (PET, HDPE etc)
	Plastic form (e.g., rigid, flexible etc)
	Plastic applications (packaging, construction etc) 
	Amount of plastics contained in “products containing plastics”
The plastic data sources can be grouped into one of the following categories:
	Statistical surveys (data collected directly from respondents in different circumstances carried out by a producer of official statistics exclusively for statistical purposes through the systematic use of statistical methodology
	Administrative data (data collected by a government ministry, department, or agency primarily for administrative [not research or statistical] purposes)
	Geospatial data (data that has a geographic component; the most prolific source of such data is satellite imagery)
	Big data (refers in general to data generated by business transactions, social media, phone logs, communication devices, web scraping, sensors, etc.)

Plastic-KEYS

Review the Data Tracker Platform 
The CSDR has developed a platform that collates plastics data sources for all countries. The data for each country is split into production, consumption, trade and waste categories.
Users should use the data sources in this tracker to extract plastics data – there is an option to download this data in a “checklist” form for the country – this format shows what data is available and where there are gaps.
1.	Access the CSDR platform “Global Plastics Data Tracker” 
2.	Download country-specific checklist with data sources
Extraction of National Data	
Beyond the data sources listed in the Tracker, the user should take stock of any other data that the government and businesses in the country currently collect (even if not published). The user should use the pre-filled in data checklist to support this action.
3.	Survey existing government databases and reporting systems
4.	Review business reporting requirements and compliance data

The below datasets can be reviewed to extract further plastics data. Further detail on the reporting process, data and geographic coverage of each of the datasets listed is set out in Annex xx.
Extraction of Production Data

5.	To gather production data, users should check if the country currently reports into one of the below databases. 

	Industrial Commodity Statistics Database (UNSD)  
	Prodcom database (Eurostat) 

Extraction of Consumption Data

6.	To gather consumption data, users should check if their country currently report into one of the below databases and/or consider utilising the “Apparent Consumption” method.

	Extended producer responsibility scheme reports
	Industry reports and datasets
	When exact data isn't available, you can use the "apparent consumption" methodology:
Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports – Exports

Extraction of Trade Data

7.	To gather trade data, users should check if their country currently report into one of the below databases.

Trade data is usually categorised through either Harmonised System (HS) codes or Standardised Industrial Trade Code (SITC). The specific plastics codes to search for are summarised in table xx.

5.2 Data Validation

To verify data values and sources, it is advisable to:
a)	Cross-validate between different data sources.
b)	Account for double-counting risks if summing data from multiple sources.
c)	Check that assumptions and conversion factors are listed and evidence-based.
For each data point category in the checklist, it is useful to assign RAG-rating to keep track of which sources of data are more/less robust. Data sources with Red or Amber-Red RAG-rating should be considered for prioritised improvement.
Data availability	Data collection/ generation	Degree of uncertainty	RAG-rating
Direct availability	Data collected directly from official statistics or statistics with a verified methodology	Small	Green
Indirect availability	Data collected from a proxy statistic such as monetary equivalency 	Medium	Amber
Estimation	Projection or forecast using verified data	High	Amber-Red
Mass balance	Flow computed by balancing corresponding inputs and outputs 	Very high	Red

Specific examples of quality assurance approaches and potential issues to be aware of for each plastics data category are listed below.
Production Data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
•	Cross-check between national and international databases
•	Compare with industry capacity data
•	Validate against trade flows
Key Quality Issues:
•	Time lags in reporting
•	Potential missing data from small producers
Consumption data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
•	Cross-validate apparent consumption calculations with market surveys
•	Compare with industry reports
•	Check consistency with waste generation data
Key Quality Issues:
•	Apparent consumption doesn't capture stockpiling
•	Informal market activities won’t be captured
Trade data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
•	Compare mirror statistics between trading partners
•	Cross-validate between national and international databases
•	Check for reporting thresholds and exemptions
Key Quality Issues:
•	Small shipments may be excluded due to reporting thresholds
•	Plastic waste trades often poorly recorded
•	Differences in partner country reporting
•	Intra-EU plastic trade flows below a set threshold in a company are estimated in official statistics (including Eurostat) leading to potential inaccuracies, especially for imports or exports of low value units, such as wastes or cheap plastic products.
Waste data
Quality Assurance Approaches:
•	Compare with consumption data 
•	Cross-check between different stages of waste management
•	Validate against EPR collection data (if available)
Key Quality Issues:
•	Informal sector activities not captured
•	Mixed waste streams difficult to characterise
•	Inconsistent measurement approaches between jurisdictions
5.3 Gap Analysis

Upon concluding the assessment of current data (extracting the data and verifying it’s accuracy), the gaps in the data checklist should be identified.
The next steps is choosing which data categories should be prioritised for development.
Prioritisation of data 
Prioritisation depends on an individual countries preferences. When a country considers which data to improve first, it should take account of:
•	The ease to fill data gaps
•	The countries need for different types of data
UNEP(xx) guidance (unpublished) advises that prioritisation of data should follow the below steps:
1: Development of datasets on plastic production and consumption
•	Collecting statistics on production of plastic
•	Collecting statistics on trade of plastic
•	Estimating consumption based on the 'apparent consumption' methodology
2: Development of plastic waste datasets
1.	Estimating plastic waste generated based on 'consumption lifespan' methodology
2.	Collecting statistics on plastic waste collection
3.	Collecting statistics on trade of plastic waste and trade of plastic embedded in waste
The UNEP guidelines prioritise three main measurement flows:
•	Plastic in primary forms
•	Semi-finished plastic products
•	Plastic in finished products
With finished products, there's a specific emphasis on tracking:
•	Pure plastic products (easier to measure, 100% plastic content)
•	High-volume categories like packaging
•	Products with significant environmental impact
Section 6 – Tools for plastic data collection
Core principles
The core principles for data collection are:
	Review multiple data sources where possible to ensure accuracy
	Apply consistent methodologies over time to enable comparisons
	Document assumptions and limitations
6.1 Data Categorisation

Units
It is suggested to express the indicators in tonnages (t, 1,000 kg), or kilo tonnages (kt) and proportion of the total plastics consumption or plastics waste generation (where appropriate). For cross-country comparisons, kg/capita should also be used, which should support comparison between countries, as well as computation of regional and global averages.
Plastic-KEYS
When establishing plastic data collection systems, governments could consider structuring their approach to align with the Plastic-KEYs classification system. Even if data cannot be collected to fill all the data categories set out in the Plastic-KEYS framework, users should consider adopting categories that might be available.
 
For each category users are encouraged to collect data on:
	Primary polymer type(s)
	Application/use category
	Weight or quantity
	Source of material (virgin/recycled)
	Expected lifetime in use
	Conversion factors used
There are Eight Plastic-KEY Groups:
	P1 Packaging 
	P2 Transport 
	P3 Building and construction 
	P4 Electrical and electronic equipment 
	P5 Consumer and institutional products 
	P6 Industrial machinery 
	P7 Textiles 
	P8 Other
These categories can be used to split data.
6.2 Surveys

For all data categories, surveys can be used to improve plastics data – the key steps to take when implementing a new survey are listed below:

1.	Implement standardised reporting templates
2.	Establish clear reporting timeframes
3.	Choose your classification system (see Annex xx)
4.	Use consistent units and conversion factors
5.	Document assumptions and conversion factors
6.3 Developing Production data
The Plastic Production indicator reflects the amount of plastic produced within the economic territory of the country during the year. To calculate plastic production at the national level, plastic in three separate flows should be considered: plastic in primary forms, semi-finished plastic products, and plastic in finished products. These three separate flows are proposed to meet policy needs while at the same time avoiding double counting, when, for example, plastic in primary forms could be counted twice, as a separate product and as part of a finished plastic product.
Role of other countries
Other countries can provide valuable data through:
•	Import Records/customs data: Detailed records of primary plastic and plastic product imports into other countries, could be used to calculate a fraction of the production in another country.

Where this data is not published, countries can write to key trading partners and request this data.

Role of Businesses
Businesses can provide data through:
•	Business reports and/ or National production surveys on: 
o	The types and quantities of plastics produced 
o	Amounts of raw materials used in plastic production
o	Production capacities and actual output from multinational companies operating in multiple countries.
o	Raw materials sourced from other countries for plastic production.

•	EPR data: If a country has an EPR scheme, importers or producers may be obliged to report on the data of products placed on the market. However, important to note that businesses may be incentivised to under report.
Role of Technology
•	Geographic Information Systems (GIS): 
o	Use GIS to create detailed maps of production facilities

•	Satellite Imagery and Remote Sensing: 
o	Monitor changes in land use related to resource extraction. Track the growth or reduction of mining sites over time.

•	Drone Technology: 
o	Survey hard-to-reach areas or large territories to map resource extraction sites.

•	Sensors and Real-time Tracking: 
o	Implement sensors at production facilities to measure output in real-time. Use RFID tags or GPS trackers on waste containers to monitor movement and final disposal locations.
Use of monetary conversion factors
To reveal plastics tonnage data, it may be possible to use conversion factors. It's important to note that these conversion factors are approximations and can vary based on products, brands, manufacturing processes, and market conditions. They are often used for broad estimates and trend analysis rather than precise calculations. Researchers and policymakers typically use these factors in combination with other data sources to get a more comprehensive picture of plastic use and flows in various industries.

Conversion	Metric 	Source (year)
Packaging sector
		
Electronics sector
		
Automotive sector
		
Consumer goods
		


6.4 Developing Consumption data
As stated in section xx – it may be possible to calculate consumption data using the below formula:
Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports
For plastic-containing products:

Adjusted Consumption = (Production × Domestic plastic content) + (Imports × Import plastic content) - (Exports × Export plastic content)
For each Plastic-KEY, apparent plastic consumption can be calculated by totalling production and imports and then subtracting the export. Total apparent plastic consumption at the national level is the sum of apparent plastic consumption of all Plastic-KEYs.

6.5 Developing Trade data (including waste trade data)

Role of Other Countries

Other countries can contribute to the development of trade data through sharing:

	Trade Documentation and Records:
o	Export/import records 
o	Customs data tracking cross-border movements of plastic materials and products
o	Documentation of transboundary plastic waste shipments
o	Port authority records of plastic material movements

	Market Intelligence:
o	Price data for traded plastic materials across different markets
o	Information on trade restrictions or regulations affecting plastic flows
o	Documentation of informal trade flows and routes
o	Regional trade agreement impacts on plastic movement

Role of Businesses
Businesses can contribute to the development of trade data through sharing:
	Trade Documentation
o	Import/export records and declarations
o	Supply chain shipping documentation
o	Customs clearance records
o	Bills of lading and freight documentation
Role of Technology
Technology enables better tracking and analysis of trade flows. Technology that can be used includes:
	Trade Flow Monitoring
o	Blockchain systems for tracking international material movements
o	RFID  and GPS  tracking of international shipments
o	Port monitoring systems for material movements

	Data Integration and Analysis
o	Trade data management platforms
o	Systems for harmonising international trade classifications
o	Cross-border shipment tracking systems
o	Trade flow visualization tools

	Documentation and Reporting
o	Digital customs documentation systems
o	Electronic trade documentation platforms
o	Automated reporting systems for trade data
o	International trade database integration tools
Each of these elements contributes to creating a comprehensive understanding of plastic trade flows, enabling better monitoring and analysis of international plastic movement.

6.6	Developing Waste data
Data on formal plastic waste collection can be collected through household surveys, municipalities’ administrative records, secondary raw materials collection points, and plastic recycling facilities. Recyclers usually have more detailed information on their plastic waste inputs, capacities, and even processing loss, which can be very valuable for the waste system.

	UNSD-UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section)

Prodcom database (Eurostat) 

The most relevant codes for measuring primary plastic production in the Prodcom database are listed below. These can all be summed to calculate Primary Plastics Production. 

The classification system of the Prodcom database is Prodcom List, an 8-digit coding system.

PRIMARY PLASTICS PRODUCTION (ordered by typical volume)
Polyethylene (PE):
	[20.16.10.35] Linear polyethylene having a specific gravity < 0,94, in primary forms 
	[20.16.10.39] Polyethylene having a specific gravity < 0,94, in primary forms (excluding linear) [20.16.10.50] Polyethylene having a specific gravity of ≥ 0,94, in primary forms 
	[20.16.10.70] Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, in primary forms 
	[20.16.10.90] Polymers of ethylene, in primary forms (excluding polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers)

PRODUCTS CONTAINING PLASTICS (ordered by typical plastic content)
The other codes in the list are for finished plastic products (like footwear, containers, tubes, etc.) rather than raw plastic production. Including these in the same category would lead to double-counting since they use plastic as an input material. It is therefore important to calculate Primary Plastic Production and Plastic Product production separately.
Codes for products that contain plastics are listed below. Assumptions will need to be applied to the volumes of these materials to determine the amount of the products that is plastic.
HIGH PLASTIC CONTENT (>90%):
	[22.21.30.10 Other plates…, of polymers of ethylene, not reinforced, thickness ≤ 0,125 mm
	[22.21.30.17 Other plates..., of polymers of ethylene, not reinforced, etc., thickness > 0,125 mm 
	[22.21.30.21 Other plates..., of biaxially orientated polymers of propylene, thickness ≤ 0,10 mm

Industrial and Production Classifications

ISIC (International Standard Industrial Classification)
The International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) is a United Nations classification system for categorizing economic activities and industries, providing a framework for collecting and reporting statistics according to such activities. Since its adoption in 1948, ISIC has provided guidance to countries in developing national activity classifications and has become an important tool for comparing statistical data on economic activities at the international level.
ISIC Rev. 4 is more detailed than previous versions, responding to the need to identify many new industries separately. Key features include:
•	Used globally to classify businesses and economic activities
•	Organised hierarchically with sections, divisions, groups, and classes
•	For plastics, the key sections include:
o	20.16: Manufacture of plastics in primary forms
o	22.20: Manufacture of plastic products
o	38.32: Recovery of sorted materials (including plastic recycling)
The ISIC system focuses on industrial activities and processes rather than the products themselves, making it particularly useful for analyzing the structure of the plastics manufacturing sector and related industries, including recycling activities. In ISIC Rev. 4, the most relevant divisions for plastic PSUT (Physical Supply-Use Tables) are Division 20 'Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products', Division 22 'Manufacture of rubber and plastics products' in section C 'Manufacturing' for production, and Division 38 'Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery' in section E for waste management.
NAICS (North American Industry Classification System): Used by the US, Canada, and Mexico
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by federal statistical agencies to classify business establishments in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
	Six-digit code system for classifying business activities 
	Developed jointly by the three North American countries 
	For plastics, key codes include: 
o	325211: Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing 
o	326: Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing 
o	326199: All Other Plastics Product Manufacturing

Industrial commodity databases (e.g., UN Industrial Commodity Statistics Database)
The UN Industrial Commodity Statistics Database is a comprehensive collection of global industrial production data. 
	Provides annual production data for major commodities 
	Uses standardised units and classifications 
	For plastics, covers: 
o	Primary plastic materials production 
o	Manufactured plastic products 
o	Industrial processing quantities
Trade and Product Classifications

HS (Harmonised System) codes
The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is an international nomenclature for the classification of products, allowing participating countries to classify traded goods on a common basis for customs purposes.
Key features include:
•	Commonly used in Trade Data
•	6-digit codes are standard internationally - countries can add more digits for national detail
•	Approximately 5,300 article/product descriptions
•	For plastics, the key codes are in Chapter 39:
o	39.01-39.14: Primary forms of plastics
o	39.15: Plastic waste and scrap
o	39.16-39.26: Plastic products
The HS classification is a six-digit grouping of goods organized primarily according to the material characteristics of goods at the time of crossing the border. Foreign trade (import and export) statistics for each product are registered under this system.

SITC (Standard International Trade Classification)
The Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) is a statistical classification of commodities designed by the United Nations for international trade analysis, allowing for global comparability of trade statistics.
SITC is characterised by:
•	Use primarily for economic analysis and global trade statistics
•	Hierarchical organization with 5 levels of detail (from 1-digit sections to 5-digit basic headings)
•	For plastics, the key codes are:
o	Division 57: Plastics in primary forms
o	Division 58: Plastics in non-primary forms
o	Section 893: Articles of plastic
Many countries and organisations continue to use SITC for various purposes, such as studying long-term trends in international merchandise trade and aggregating traded commodities into classes more suitable for economic analysis.
CPC (Central Product Classification)
The Central Product Classification (CPC) is a comprehensive classification system for all goods and services produced in an economy. It provides a framework for the collection and reporting of statistics on production, consumption, trade, and other economic activities.
CPC version 2.1 offers several advantages:
•	Used for both goods and services categorization
•	Designed to harmonize with other major classification systems
•	For plastics, the relevant sections include:
o	Group 347: Plastics in primary forms (in division 34 'Basic chemicals')
o	Group 363: Semi-manufactures of plastics
o	Group 364: Packaging products of plastics
o	Group 369: Other plastic products (in division 36 'Rubber and plastics products')
As a general-purpose classification, CPC provides less detail than other specific classification systems but serves as an international standard that facilitates the maintenance of constant categories of products.
Waste Classifications 

The European List of Waste (LoW) and European Waste Classification for Statistics (EWC-Stat) serve distinct but complementary functions in waste management. LoW is an administrative classification system with 839 waste types organized into 20 chapters based primarily on waste sources, using six-digit codes for permitting and operational management. In contrast, EWC-Stat is designed specifically for statistical reporting to Eurostat, aggregating LoW categories into substance-oriented groups. These systems maintain a one-to-many relationship, where a single EWC-Stat category may correspond to multiple LoW codes. While most countries collect data using LoW for operational purposes, they then convert this information to EWC-Stat categories for standardized European statistical reporting, creating an integrated approach to waste classification.
European List of Waste (LoW)
The European List of Waste (LoW) is the waste classification in the EU for administrative purposes, used for permitting and supervision in waste generation and management. The LoW defines 839 waste types structured into 20 chapters, mainly according to the waste's source. Each waste type is characterized by a six-digit code.
There are eight LoW codes that refer to plastic waste, all referring to non-hazardous waste:
•	15 01 02: plastic packaging
•	02 01 04: waste plastics (except packaging) from agriculture, horticulture, etc.
•	07 02 13: waste plastics from plastics manufacturing
•	12 01 05: plastics shavings and turnings
•	16 01 19: Plastics from end-of-life vehicles
•	17 02 03: Plastics from construction and demolition
•	19 12 04: plastics and rubber from mechanical treatment of waste
•	20 01 39: Plastics from separately collected municipal waste fractions
EWC-Stat (European Waste Classification for Statistics)
The European Waste Classification for Statistics (EWC-Stat) is a statistical classification system designed to categorize waste materials for reporting and monitoring purposes across the European Union. 
	Primarily used for waste statistics reporting to Eurostat 
	Organised in a hierarchical structure with main categories and sub-categories
	For plastics, the key categories include: 
o	07.4: Plastic waste 
o	07.4.1: Plastic packaging waste 
o	07.4.2: Other plastic wastes
EWC-Stat is mainly a substance-oriented aggregation of the waste types defined in the LoW, creating a 1:n-relationship between EWC-Stat and LoW. While the Waste Statistics Regulation stipulates that EWC-Stat must be used for reporting data to Eurostat, countries can use any waste classification as long as they can produce the defined formats in the required quality.
Integrated Environmental-Economic Frameworks

Plastic-KEYs classification system for finished products
The Plastic-KEY system, developed by UNITAR, is a classification system to help compile plastic statistics and map links between plastic consumption and waste management. Products in one Plastic-KEY share:
•	Similar function, comparable material composition, and related end-of-life attributes
•	Homogeneous average weight and lifetime distribution
The 59 Plastic-KEYs can be aggregated into eight Plastic-KEY Groups:
•	P1 Packaging
•	P2 Transport
•	P3 Building and construction
•	P4 Electrical and electronic equipment
•	P5 Consumer and institutional products
•	P6 Industrial machinery
•	P7 Textiles
•	P8 Other
Plastic-KEYs can be employed statistically in several ways:
1.	To collect statistical data on consumption on the market through the apparent consumption methodology
2.	To estimate the amount of different polymer types in each category and economic sector
3.	To model and assess plastic waste generated from each category using material flow analysis
The system provides links between CPC codes for domestic production and HS codes for trade statistics, helping to establish connections between primary plastic and products containing plastic on the market.

	Provides data-driven roadmap development 
	Focuses on systemic transformation 
	Key areas include: 
o	Waste generation assessment 
o	Collection and recycling analysis 
o	Circular economy pathways
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes
The Basel Convention regulates the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and other wastes and provides for such wastes to be managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Plastic waste is classified under specific entries in the Convention:
•	Entry Y48 in Annex II
•	Entry A3210 in Annex VIII
•	Entry B3011 in Annex IX
Parties to the Basel Convention submit annual national reports containing statistical information on the transboundary movements of plastic waste.
